# Shopping Basket in React using a Custom Hook

I created a shopping basket in React using a custom hook that allows users to add items,
decrement items, and limits the amount of items that a customer can have. Although the design is not meant to be beautiful,
it was created as a way to practice working with hooks.


Overall, creating a shopping basket with a custom hook was a valuable exercise in using React hooks and state management.
